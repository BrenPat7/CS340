1. Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

I structure my code around modular components as a Python class or function with a single responsibility. For example, in Project One I encapsulated CRUD operations in a self‑contained AnimalCrud module. In Project Two, I simply imported and reused those same methods to connect my Dash widgets to the MongoDB backend. This separation of concerns reduced duplication, made debugging easier, and simplified future changes. Also with the mind set of prototyping, as in I will chip away until I am able to get something close to what is expected. 

2. Computer Science Problem‑Solving Approach

When given Grazioso Salvare’s dashboard requirements, I began by breaking down the problem: what data queries were needed, which visual components best represented that data, and how the front end should respond to user input. I sketched wireframes and listed API endpoints before writing code. Compared to earlier courses (where assignments often had fixed, linear steps), this project required iterative prototyping and feedback: I assembled minimal end‑to‑end functionality first, then refined UI layout, error handling, and performance. In future database designs, I’ll continue to start with data modeling, validate with sample documents, and build aggregation queries before integrating them into application logic.

3. The Role and Impact of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists design abstractions that transform raw data into actionable insights. By automating data retrieval, filtering, and visualization, my dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare quickly track key metrics (e.g., animal intake vs. outcome rates). This efficiency not only saves staff time but also reduces errors in manual reporting. In a broader context, well‑engineered software empowers organizations to make data‑driven decisions rapidly, improving overall effectiveness and enabling scalable growth.
